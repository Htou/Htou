### Hey there, my name is Hichem <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

A software engineer (and philsophy) student specializing in general backend development with technologies listed in the toolbox below.

I like to work on building useful applications, mostly with Java and Python, that are deployable on the cloud solutions like AWS, but I am also developing myself in other areas such as team building, scrum and clean agile. Add me on LinkedIn to follow my progresss.

I started coding back when doing a web devlopment bootcamp back in 2018, but after trying to get in the software development field I came to the conclusion that technical skills were not adiquate, thus I persued an education in software Development.
