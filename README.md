### Hey there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, my name is Hichem

---
A software Engineer (and philsophy) student specializing in backend development with technologies listed in the toolbox below.

I like to work on building useful applications, mostly with Java and Python, that are deployable on the cloud like aws, but I am also developing myself in other areas such as team building, scrum and clean agile. Hit me up with a subscribe to follow my progress.

I started coding back when doing a web devloper bootcamp back in 2018, after trying to get in the workfield
