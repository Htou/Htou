A software engineer (and philsophy) student specializing in general backend development with technologies listed in the toolbox below.

I like to work on building useful applications, mostly with Java and Python, that are deployable on the cloud like aws, but I am also developing myself in other areas such as team building, scrum and clean agile. Hit me up with a conntection on LinkedIn to follow my progresss.

I started coding back when doing a web devloper bootcamp back in 2018, after trying to get in the workfield
